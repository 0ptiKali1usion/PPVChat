This is old. Basically useless, since Adobe shutdown Flash. BUT, my old employers paid $1000 USD for it back in the day, so it should be archived somewhere. Right?
I was going to make something like this for them, but, they wanted it now, today, yesterday.
So, I found this for them. It's for people that want to chat with webcam people, for money.
Also, it's for people that want to make money off of those other people (admins/models charging clients).
I suppose, if you wanted to start your own myfreecams.com you could still use this code, but, you'd need to modify it so it doesn't rely on Flash/Shockwave/Adobe/whatever (it's been a long time. can't even remember how I did the job. but, it's fun to reminisce :) )
